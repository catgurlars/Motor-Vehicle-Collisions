# Motor-Vehicle-Collisions
Over the past four years, injuries due to motor vehicle collisions in New York City have increased
by a whopping 18% (Furfaro & Moore, 2019). This startling statistic necessitates a deeper analysis into the
causes and contributions of New York City’s injurious traffic collisions. Past research surrounding motor
vehicle collisions has often been framed around the dangerous behaviors that impair one’s judgement or
ability to drive. Driving recklessly while intoxicated, high, tired, or on a cell phone are all ways in which
individual actions have been found to increase the probability of injury or even death on the road (Stubig
et al. 2012; et al. 2013; Bener 2017). However, for every person that crashes as a result of such risky or
distracted behavior, there is oftentimes another party that is simply the victim of poor circumstances. For
the average person who is not at fault, what other factors might contribute to a higher probability of danger?
Fewer studies have focused on answering this question by exploring the circumstantial (rather than
behavioral) predictors of traffic injury.
